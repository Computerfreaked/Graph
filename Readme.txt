Open the file "install libraries.R" and choose Rstudio (and tick always use this program/app). Press Ctrl + Shift + Enter. If asked always choose to install the latest version, even if this requires compiling. This will output some things in the console and may take a while, wait for the console to show a ">" to indicate it is done. Close Rstudio.

Place your exported FlowJo excel files in the input directory and open the file "graph parallel.R" -- from windows -- (not from inside Rstudio). This should open Rstudio for you, now Press Ctrl + Shift + Enter to start the script.
